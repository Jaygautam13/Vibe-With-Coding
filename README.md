# 🌆 AI-Powered Smart City Management System (Software-Only)

## 👤 Author Introduction
Hello! I’m **Jay Gautam**, a passionate Computer Science student who loves **AI, Web Development, and Smart Solutions**.  
Currently, I’m in my **3rd year of B.Tech (CSE)**, building projects that combine **AI + Software + Real-world Impact**.  

I believe in using **Artificial Intelligence** to solve real-world urban challenges, and this project is a step towards **smarter, sustainable cities of the future**. 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Smart City Management System** is a **software-only simulation-based platform** designed to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence can optimize **urban infrastructure, services, and resources**.  

This project does not use physical IoT devices or sensors but instead relies on **open datasets, synthetic data, and simulation tools** to model and predict real-world scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **software-driven smart city simulation system**.  
- Use **AI/ML models** to predict, optimize, and manage city services.  
- Provide **dashboards & visualizations** for government and citizens.  
- Simulate real-world problems like traffic, pollution, waste, and emergencies.  
- Create a **scalable foundation** that can later integrate with IoT hardware.

## ✨ Features
### 1. Traffic & Mobility
- Traffic flow prediction using ML (LSTM, GNN).  
- Smart traffic signal simulation.  
- Route optimization and congestion heatmaps.  

### 2. Utilities & Environment
- Energy demand forecasting.  
- Water supply anomaly detection.  
- Air quality & pollution prediction.  
- Waste collection optimization.  

### 3. Public Safety & Emergency
- Crime pattern detection.  
- Emergency response simulation (ambulance/fire dispatch).  
- Disaster management simulation (flood, heatwave).  

### 4. Citizen Services
- Smart complaint portal (AI chatbot).  
- Personalized dashboards for citizens.  
- Feedback & suggestion module.  

### 5. Digital Twin (City Simulation)
- Virtual city environment using SUMO, EPANET, and synthetic data.  
- AI-driven prediction for urban growth & planning.
